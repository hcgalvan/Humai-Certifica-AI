develop a model that could detect body pose landmarcks and overlay them over real-time video feed to direct correct body posture for an excercise describe in a target video performed by a professional

Additionally, we formulated a score for describing difference in the inference posture and posture stillness score, form the target posture irrespective of body position, shape and size.

built an inference pipeline that was capable of delivering more than 20 FPS in real time, "detecting poses" and classifying them
